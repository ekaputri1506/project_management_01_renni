            <ul>Hello, here are some projects that I made related with Project Management Professional (PMP), please click on below text link.</ul><br/>
                
                <li>Activity Table displays activity information in spreadsheet format. Use this type of layout to quickly update a
                project. Use the Fill Down function to quickly copy and paste contents of rows in the Activity Table. You can use
                filters and group data to see only those activities that occur in your current status cycle. You can customize Activity
                Table columns. You can also sort, filter, and group activities in the Activity Table, as well as change the font of the
                activity information and the color of the table background. The Activity Table is displayed in the top and bottom
                layouts.</li> <br/>

                <li>Gantt Chart provides a graphical display of activity progress over the course of the project. You can customize Gantt
                Chart bars, colors, labels, and symbols. You can also sort, filter, and group activities in the Gantt Chart. The Gantt
                Chart is displayed in the top and bottom layouts.</li> <br/>

                <li>Earned value is a technique for measuring project performance according to both project costs and the schedule. This
                technique compares the budgeted cost of the work to the actual cost. While earned value analyses are typically performed
                for WBS elements, you can also perform an earned value analysis for activities and groups of activities.</li>
